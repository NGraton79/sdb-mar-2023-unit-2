# Variables

Variables are used to store and to point to things in memory, so we are able to reference it later on in the script.

Ex: Algebra

```js
x = 15

x + 5 = ? //20

```

In JS all variables must have `unique names`

### Rules for naming

- Names can contain letters, numbers, underscores, and even $.
- Names MUST begin with a letter.
- Names can begin with $ or \_ (not really used).
- Names are case sensitive (x and X are different)
- Reserve words CANNOT be used (class, let, const, var, etc...)
